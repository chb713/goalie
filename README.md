## Getting Started

First, unzip the Goalie source code file to a directory, and enter that directory in the terminal of your choice.

In this example, we've unzipped Goalie into a directory on our desktop called **goalie**:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/goalie
```

Next, install dependencies using [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm i
```

## Running the application

### File-based Input

Get started with Goalie on the command line by doing a test run using the included `input.txt` sample file:

```javascript
npm run goalie samples/input.txt
```

You should see the input provided by the file, followed by the leaderboard for each matchday once the day is deemed complete.

A leaderboard looks like this:

```javascript
Matchday 1
Capitola Seahorses, 3 pts
Felton Lumberjacks, 3 pts
San Jose Earthquakes, 1 pts
```

Any time you'd like to use Goalie with a file-based input, just use the file path as the first argument:

```bash
npm run goalie path/to/my/awesome/file.txt
```

### Direct Input

Next, use Goalie with direct input by running the command with no arguments:

```bash
npm run goalie
```

Enter match results one-per-line like so:

```bash
San Jose Earthquakes 3, Santa Cruz Slugs 3
```

The input match result format should be:

```bash
Team1 Score1, Team2 Score2
```

Once you have entered a match result, hit return, and Goalie will process the line.

If enough results have been entered to determine that a matchday is complete, Goalie will output a leaderboard for the matchday automatically.

**You just started tracking soccer match results in realtime with Goalie. It's time for a pint! üçª**

## Running Tests

Goalie uses the excellent [Jest](https://jestjs.io) testing framework for tests.

To run Goalie's tests, simply run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
